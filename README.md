## About Me  
I’m a Naturopathic Physician and former Assistant Professor with over 25 years of experience in integrative primary care, medical education, and clinical research. Currently, I am completing an NLM T15 Postdoctoral Fellowship at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), specializing in bioinformatics and computational biomedicine. My work applies systems biology, neuroendocrine-immunology, and data science to explore Salutogenesis—the biological processes that promote health and resilience. I focus on integrating traditional and digital biomarkers—including wearable sensor data—to uncover insights into physiological resilience and derive better health outcomes.  I’m particularly interested in translating complex biological data into scalable solutions for preventive health, digital therapeutics, and personalized care.
