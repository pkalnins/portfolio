## About Me  
Dedicated Naturopathic Physician and former Assistant Professor with over 25 years of experience in integrative primary care, medical education, and clinical research. Currently an NLM Postdoctoral Fellow at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), specializing in bioinformatics and computational biomedicine. My work focuses on understanding salutogenesis‚Äîthe processes that promote health and resilience‚Äîthrough systems biology and computational approaches. I am particularly interested in leveraging both traditional and digital biomarkers, including data from wearable sensors, to analyze biological rhythms, assess physiological resilience, and optimize health outcomes.
